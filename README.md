# Azure Infrastructure Templates

## Overview

This repository aims to accelerate the depoyment of common Data and AI workloads in Azure. It has been implemented through the use of Azure Bicep declarative infrastructure as code.

The services across each template address one or more different problems of data, AI and IoT use-cases - governance and management, ingestion, storage, processing, enrichment, serving. The following diagram illustrates the different services and the problems they address where each template has been outlined with a dashed box.
