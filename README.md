# Azure Infrastructure Templates

## Overview

This repository aims to accelerate the depoyment of common Data and AI workloads in Azure. It has been implemented through the use of Azure Bicep declarative infrastructure as code.

The services across each template address one or more different problems of data, AI and IoT use-cases - governance and management, ingestion, storage, processing, enrichment, serving. The following diagram illustrates the different services and the problems they address where each template has been outlined with a dashed box.

> Please note the templates in this repository are intended for proof-of-concept deployments. For a more production ready solution see: [Azure Analytics End to End with Azure Synapse - Deployment Accelerator](https://github.com/fabragaMS/AzureAnalyticsE2E)

## Deployment

### Deployment Types

Each template can be deployed in two modes: `poc` (which is the default) or `secure`.

| Deployment Mode   | Description |
|:------------------|:------------------|
| `poc` | Simple deployment configuration which is suitable for proof-of-concepts. Supported templates include: `data-management`, `data-synapse-workspace`, `data-databricks-workspace`, `data-azureml-workspace`, `iot-streaming`. |
| `secure` | Secure deployment configuration aligning with enterprise security requirements such as restricting user access, limiting network communication, applying data encryption, etc. Supported templates include: |

### Template Details
