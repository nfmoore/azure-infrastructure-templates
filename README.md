# Azure Infrastructure Templates

## Overview

This repository aims to accelerate the deployment of common workloads in Azure. It has been implemented through the use of Azure Bicep declarative infrastructure as code. It has been designed around five types of workloads - data management and analytics, machine learning and artifical intellegence, the internet of things (IoT), application development and cloud infrastructure.

## Deployment Types

Each template can be deployed in two modes: `poc` (which is the default) or `secure`.

| Deployment Mode   | Description |
|:------------------|:------------------|
| `poc` | Simple deployment configuration which is suitable for proof-of-concepts. Supported templates include: `data-management`, `data-synapse-workspace`, `data-databricks-workspace`, `ai-azureml-workspace`, `iot-streaming`, `apps-microservices`. |

## Template Details

Each template aims to deploy infrastructure to address common cloud workloads.
